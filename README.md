# Change file names
This is a simple node script that I use to quickly change file names.

The original use case was for a folder of images with a name pattern of image_nnnn.png, with n being a number between 0 and 0192.

I needed to rename them using the following pattern: nimage.png (1image.png - 192image.png).
